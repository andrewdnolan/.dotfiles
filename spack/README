# Using Spack as the package manager on Mac OS X
If spack is not already install, then do so:
```shell
git clone -c feature.manyFiles=true --depth=2 https://github.com/spack/spack.git
. spack/share/spack/setup-env.sh
```

The create the environment, concretize it, and install the needed packages:
```shell
spack env create osx-env ~/.dotfiles/spack/osx-env.sh
spack -e osx-env concretize
spack -e osx-env install
```

This environment includes a newer Bash installation.
In order to change the default shell to this installation,
we first need to add it to the list of acceptable shells.
Sign into the admin account
```shell
sudo vim /etc/shells
```

Then, return to your user account, and run:
```
chsh -s /path/to/bash
```
After you restart you shell, run `echo $SHELL` to confirm it points to the
newer version of bash.
